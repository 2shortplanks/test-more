0.03  Fri Mar 30 08:08:33 BST 2001
    - ok() now prints on what line and file it failed.
    - eval 'die' was considered abnormal.  Fixed.

0.02  Fri Mar 30 05:12:14 BST 2001      *UNRELEASED*
    - exit codes tested
    * exit code on abnormal exit changed to 255 (thanks to Tim Bunce for
      pointing out that Unix can't do negative exit codes)
    - abnormal exits now better caught.
    - No longer using Test.pm to test this, but still minimum of 5.005
      due to needing $^S.
