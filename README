NAME
    Test2 - Framework for writing test tools that all work together.

EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE
    This is an experimental release. Using this right now is not
    recommended.

DESCRIPTION
    Test2 is a new testing framework produced by forking Test::Builder,
    completely refactoring it, adding many new features and capabilities.

GETTING STARTED
    If you are interested in writing tests using new tools then you should
    look at NOT YET DETERMINED.

    If you are interested in writing new tools you should take a look at
    Test2::API first.

SEE ALSO
    Test2::API - Primary API functions.

    Test2::Context - Detailed documentation of the context object.

    Test2::API - Interface to global state. This is where to look if you
    need a tool to produce a global effect.

    Test2::IPC - The IPC system used for threading/fork support.

    Test2::Formatter - Formatters such as TAP live here.

    Test2::Event - Events live in this namespace.

    Test2::Hub - All events eventually funnel through a hub. Custom hubs are
    how "intercept()" and "run_subtest()" are implemented.
