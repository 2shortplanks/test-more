NAME
    Test::Stream - Experimental successor to Test::Builder

EXPERIMENTAL CODE WARNING
    This is an experimental release! Test-Stream, and all its components are
    still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to cpan in
    order to allow testers and early adopters the chance to write
    experimental new tools with it, or to add experimental support for it
    into old tools.

    PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETELY CONVERT OLD TOOLS YET. This experimental
    release is very likely to see a lot of code churn. API's may break at
    any time. Test-Stream should NOT be depended on by any toolchain level
    tools until the experimental phase is over.
